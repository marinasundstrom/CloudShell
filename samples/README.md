# Samples

This directory contains sample projects used to verify and demonstrate different CloudShell scenarios.

## Creating a new sample

### Blazor applications

For the CloudShell hosting application to be compiled correctly as a Blazor application, the project must contain at least one Razor file.

If the sample does not define any custom Razor components, add an `_Imports.razor` file with the following content:

```razor
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web
```

### Ignoring the Data directory

The Control Plane may create a `Data` directory during execution. Since this directory contains generated data, it should typically not be committed to source control.

To exclude it from Git, add a `.gitignore` file with the following content:

```text
Data
```

This ensures that the `Data` directory is ignored by Git.
